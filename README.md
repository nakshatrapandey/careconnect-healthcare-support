# CareConnect – Mini Healthcare Support Web App

## Overview
CareConnect is a concept-level healthcare support web application designed for NGOs.
It provides a simple digital interface for collecting patient concerns and offering
basic guidance through an automated chatbot.

The project focuses on clarity, usability, and demonstrating how AI or automation
can support healthcare initiatives at an early stage.

---

## Tech Stack

- CSS
- JavaScript

## AI / Automation Idea
The chatbot currently uses rule-based automation to ensure reliability for a
concept-level healthcare demo.

A backend architecture using Node.js and Express has been implemented to securely
integrate AI models such as Google Gemini using environment variables.

During testing, AI responses were restricted due to safety and policy constraints
for this account/region. To ensure a stable user experience, the rule-based chatbot
is used as a fallback while still demonstrating how AI would be integrated in a
production environment.

## NGO Use Case
CareConnect can be used by healthcare NGOs to:
- Collect patient or volunteer queries digitally
- Provide instant responses to common FAQs
- Reduce manual workload for NGO staff
- Act as a foundation for future AI-powered healthcare support systems
